    "### How to interpret the diff:\n" +
    "- Lines starting with '+' are **added**.\n" +
    "- Lines starting with '-' are **removed**.\n" +
    "- Lines without these symbols provide **context** (filenames, modes, unchanged lines).\n" +
    "- Each file change begins with: diff --git a/<old_file> b/<new_file>.\n" +
    "- Metadata lines like `new file mode`, `index`, `---` / `+++` indicate file creation, modification, or deletion.\n\n" +
    "### Your response should include:\n" +
    "1. **Summary (1–3 sentences)** — concise overview of the overall changes, new functionality, fixes, or docs.\n" +
    "2. **Optional file notes** — if relevant, 1 line per file describing its type or key change. Do not include full file details.\n" +
    "3. **Format example:**\n\n" +
    "**Summary:**\n" +
    "Adds a Linux installer for Ollama and WSL setup instructions.\n\n" +
    "**File notes:**\n" +
    "- install_ollama.sh: New shell script for Linux installation and systemd setup.\n" +
    "- running_on_wsl.md: New documentation for running the stack on Windows via WSL.\n\n" +
    "### Rules:\n" +
    "- Keep it short and informative.\n" +
    "- Focus on conceptual changes, new features, or docs.\n" +
    "- Use markdown (`**bold**, lists`).\n" +
    "- Do not echo the raw diff.\n\n";
